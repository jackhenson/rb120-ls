overview: |
    Twenty-One is a card game consisting of a dealer and a player, where the 
    participants try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

    Here is an overview of the game:
    - Both participants are initially dealt 2 cards from a 52-card deck.
    - The player takes the first turn, and can "hit" or "stay".
    - If the player busts, he loses. If he stays, it's the dealer's turn.
    - The dealer must hit until his cards add up to at least 17.
    - If he busts, the player wins. If both player and dealer stays, then the 
      highest total wins.
    - If both totals are equal, then it's a tie, and nobody wins.

scoring: |
    All of the card values are pretty straightforward, except for the ace. 
    Numbers 2 through 10 are worth their face value. 
    The jack, queen, and king are each worth 10.
    The ace can be worth 1 or 11. 

    Ace scoring rules:
    The ace's value is determined each time a new card is drawn from the deck.
    If the sum of the hand doesn't exceed 21, the Ace is worth 11.
    If the sum of the hand exceeds 21, the Ace is worth 1.
